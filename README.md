# Order Management System – Deployed API & Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains the backend API and documentation for the Order Management System, now deployed as a web service. The API is hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., Render) and is accessible for integration, testing, and production use.

**Key technologies:**
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- PostgreSQL (production), H2 (dev/test)
- Swagger/OpenAPI for live API docs
- Docker for deployment
- Postman for API testing
- JUnit for automated tests

## Deployed API Access

The API is available as a web service. You can:
- Access live API documentation via Swagger UI: `/swagger-ui.html` or `/swagger-ui/index.html` on the deployed URL
- Use the `/api/orders` endpoint for order management operations (CRUD)
- Integrate with the API from any frontend or external system

*Note: The frontend application will be developed and hosted separately.*

## How to Use the Deployed API

1. Visit the deployed API URL (see your cloud provider dashboard for the endpoint)
2. Explore and test endpoints using Swagger UI (`/swagger-ui.html` or `/swagger-ui/index.html`)
3. Integrate with `/api/orders` for order management
4. Use Postman or other tools for API testing

## Deployment & Operations

- The API is containerized with Docker and deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., Render)
- Environment variables and database connections are managed for production reliability
- Connection pool and resource limits are configured for cloud hosting

## Project Structure

- `/docs` – Project documentation (roadmap, backlog, Gantt chart, etc.)
- `/src` – Java source code
- `/docker` – Docker scripts/configs
- `/postman` – Postman API collections

## Next Steps

- Monitor the deployed API for reliability and performance
- Update documentation as endpoints and features evolve
- Add more usage examples and integration guides

**For contributors:** Please refer to the project roadmap and backlog in the `/docs` folder for current objectives, milestones, and accepted practices. Focus on improving the deployed API and its documentation for production use.
